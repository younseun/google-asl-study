We need to know that our chosen set of hyperparameters will work well for data we haven't seen before because in production, that will be the case. For this reason, we create a third dataset that we never use during the model development process. We only evaluate on this once our model development is finished. Data scientists don't always create a test dataset (aka holdout dataset), but to be thorough you should.\n",
